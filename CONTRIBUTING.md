# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to help us!
Read this document for information on how to get started.

## General overview of project

We use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to generate the static website.
All our website styling is done with the [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) framework.

## What you'll need to know to be able to help

You'll need a basic understanding of HTML/CSS to be able to help with the code.
It's even better if you know a bit of React and the basics of TypeScript.

## Software requirements

- Git
- pnpm package manager (version specified in "engines" property within `package.json`)
- Latest version of Node.js 16 (optional)

This guide assumes you'll run the code on your workstation directly.

### Where to get Git

The [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) site has links to download Git for your operating system.

### Where to get pnpm

In case you didn't get pnpm setup in your environment, [there are different ways of installing/updating it](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Where to get Node.js (optional)

You can install Node.js through a [Node.js version manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/install#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm).
However, [pnpm can manage the Node.js version automatically for you](https://pnpm.io/blog/2021/12/29/yearly-update#managing-nodejs-versions-since-v6120), so you can run it even with no Node.js preinstalled on the system.

## Make a fork

Use the GitHub web interface to create your own fork of the Octochangelog repository.

Do not put your own work on your forks `main` branch.
Create a new feature branch for each bit of work!

## Installing development dependencies

We use Yarn v1 to manage our dependencies.
Run the `pnpm install` command in your own Octochangelog directory to install all dependencies:

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

## Development process

You're ready to start work now.
We recommend you follow this process:

1. Create a feature branch
1. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`
1. Make the necessary changes
1. Put chunks of work in a commit (the Husky program will run some checks for modified files)
1. Write/adjust tests to check the functionality of the new code
1. Create pull request
1. Fix code validation problems reported and failed tests from CI

## Mocked API

We use [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) to mock API calls.
Now you can run Jest tests, Cypress tests and the local environment against this mocked API, without needing a real connection or reaching GitHub API's limit.

### Toggling the mocked API

This mocked API can be toggled through the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MOCKING` environment variable, which is disabled by default for local development (but enabled in CI). Use `enabled` to start it alongside the project, or `disabled` to stop it.

You can put it in your `.env.local` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MOCKING=enabled` (restarting the local server if already started).

### Limitations

The endpoint to search repositories (used in the _Enter repository name_ input field in the comparator) only returns a couple of results for "testing library" and "renovate", so it's only possible to search those terms.

## Query string to check comparator output

Use the following query string to check the comparator output:

```
?repo=testing-library%2Fdom-testing-library&from=v6.16.0&to=v8.1.0
```

## Working on dark mode locally

We've hidden the color mode behind a feature flag called `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG_COLOR_MODE`.
This way we can work on the dark mode without publishing the feature.

Do the following to get a ugly button to toggle between light/dark mode:

1. Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of the project (this file is on the `.gitignore` list so it won't be committed accidentally)
1. Put `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_FLAG_COLOR_MODE=true` inside the `.env.local` file.
1. You can now use the button in the header to switch between light/dark mode

### Setting colors for light/dark mode

You only need to pass 2 values to `useColorModeValue`:

- the first one is the variant for light mode
- the second one is the variant for dark mode

Save the values in a `const` that will _automagically_ get the corresponding value based on the current color mode.
You can use this `const` anywhere, but most of the time it will be passed to a Chakra component prop.

You can use `useColorModeValue` as many times you need/want inside a component to generate several variables based on color mode.

### Example in code

Here's an example of how to colorize a component.

1. Create/edit a `const` that contains the colors.
1. Ue the `const` within a Chakra property.

```typescript
const Footer = () => {
	const boxBgColor = useColorModeValue('gray.50', 'gray.900')

	return (
		<Box as="footer" bg={boxBgColor}>
			<Container></Container>
		</Box>
	)
}

export default Footer
```

### Running E2E

Our E2E tests are implemented with Cypress.
They are ran against a mocked API with MSW.

We run a weekly smoke test on the real GitHub API.
